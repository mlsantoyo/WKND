# Welcome to The Wknd!

## Even with modern technology, planning an event with friends can be a major pain...

The Wknd seeks to provide a mobile responsive and intuitive way to coordinate a fun time with friends, whether it's you and a buddy heading to a concert or your Coding Bootcamp cohort planning a night "coding" at the local bar.

#### How does it work?

**Hosting:**

* If you're looking to plan a night out with your friends, simply pull up our website on your computer or mobile device broser.

* Click "I am hosting".

* Choose where you want to go with your friends.

* Edit the invitation for your hangout
... NOTE: this will generate a unique PINvitation that your friends can use to join your event.

* This will take you to your main event page, where you can view your event information and interact with your guests.

**Attending:**

* Did your friends already take the initiative to plan your event? Navigate to our webpage on your computer or mobile device to join in the fun!

* Simply click "I have a PINvitation". Then, just enter your user information as well as your Pinvitation and you will be taken to your event page! From here, you can view the information for your event and interact with other guests.

### Future Plans

We foresee the following implementations that would optimize the user's experience using our web application:

* Letting users publish their events directly to social media. 

* Creating sign in features that save user preferences, and implementing an algorithim that would generate suggested events based off the user's previous events that they attended. So if most of your events are nightclubs, your suggested events will show up. Creating an account for users that stores their previous events would also allow users to quickly choose the same event every week (i.e. Taco Tuesdays).

* Generate a more unique PIN. Currently it would be fairly easy for a random person to randomly input keys and join events because the current PINvitation is only 4 digits. **However**, it is important to note that we did not want to implement an alphanumeric and long PINvitation because it detracts from the lightweight and quick to access experience of our web application. 

* Offer suggestions based on geolocation. Currently, we are limited to the city of Orlando.

* Monetize. We could potentially work with local businesses to form partnerships. We could have a special section on our homepage to promote specials and deals, in exchange for a kickback from the business.
